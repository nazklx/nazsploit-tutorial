## How to hack 'Pythonically'

While Pythonic thinking is rooted in the Python language, I believe that its base principles can extend into many more concepts- such as hacking. If you haven't read the above article linked, I highly suggest reading it- even if you don't know Python. You can take the quotes and remove the word "Python" in them to bring it to a broader view- which is what I'm trying to do in my little tutorials that I make while I'm learning them myself.

### Simple & Easy To Understand

As I've gone through tutorials of various concepts myself, it's hard to find something intelligible, portable, and most importantly: _free and accessible_.
